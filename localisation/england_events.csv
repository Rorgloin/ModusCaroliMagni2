EVTNAMEmoduscarolimagni.3121;England Claims France;
EVTDESCmoduscarolimagni.3121;The King of England, claimant and self-proclaimed rightful ruler of France, has boldly declared his rightful place by adopting French Heraldry into his banner. This bodes poorly for the future of relations between the two kingdoms, and only time will tell who will rule France.;
EVTOPTAmoduscarolimagni.3121;Those bastards!;
EVTOPTBmoduscarolimagni.3121;Dieu et mon droit!;
EVTNAMEmoduscarolimagni.3122;England Abandons French Heraldry;
EVTDESCmoduscarolimagni.3122;His old claims lost, and with no ambition to ever return to France, the King of England has readopted the banner of old, once again proudly displaying the three lions as the only part of the English banner. No longer shall the King of England display ancient French Heraldry in his own banner.;
EVTOPTAmoduscarolimagni.3122;Vive le roi!;
EVTOPTBmoduscarolimagni.3122;England shall never die!;
