EVTNAMEmoduscarolimagni.3121;England Claims France;
EVTDESCmoduscarolimagni.3121;The [From.GetTitle] of England, claimant and self-proclaimed rightful ruler of France, has boldly declared [From.GetPossPronoun] rightful place by adopting French Heraldry into [From.GetPossPronoun] banner. This bodes poorly for the future of relations between the two kingdoms, and only time will tell who will rule France.;
EVTOPTAmoduscarolimagni.3121;Those bastards!;
EVTOPTBmoduscarolimagni.3121;Dieu et mon droit!;
EVTNAMEmoduscarolimagni.3122;England Abandons French Heraldry;
EVTDESCmoduscarolimagni.3122;[From.GetPossPronoun] old claims lost, and with no ambition to ever return to France, the [From.GetRulerTitle] of England has readopted the banner of old, once again proudly displaying the three lions as the only part of the English banner. No longer shall the King of England display ancient French Heraldry in [From.GetPossPronoun] own banner.;
EVTOPTAmoduscarolimagni.3122;Vive le roi!;
EVTOPTBmoduscarolimagni.3122;England shall never die!;

EVTOPTAmoduscarolimagni.3123;There is only one [Root.GetTitle] of France!;
